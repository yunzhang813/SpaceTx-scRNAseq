# SpaceTx-scRNAseq
The goal of this repository is to collect data that will be used to support the mapping of cell types identified in spatial transcriptomics experiments with cell types previously identified in single cell and single nucleus RNAseq experiments.

The NS-Forest_mouse-V1-scRNAseq_merFISH-probes_v1.csv contains the minimum set of marker genes that gives maximum classification accuracy given the input probe set used for the merFISH experiment as applied to the consensus clustering results for mouse visual cortex.  The F-measure value gives a quantitative measure of the cell type-specific classification accuracy given the probe set used in the experiment.
